conventional tillage with straw returning, CTS; no-tillage, NT; and conventional tillage, CT);The elevated O3 concentration tended to increase AM colonization of wheat seedling and bate plant growth during the booting period, then significantly (p < 0.05) reduced aerial biomass, individual yield and kernel weight by 22%, 29% and 9%, respectively, and decreased soil microbial biomass N by 37% after wheat harvesting;In the whole rice growth period, the alkali-hydrolyzable N and total N contents in 0-5 cm soil layer were significantly higher but in 5-12 cm and 12-20 cm soil layers were lower under NT than under CT, and the NH4(+)-N and NO3(-)-N contents in 0-20 cm soil layer were higher under NTS but in 12-20 cm soil layer had no significant differences between NT and CT;Vertical and 'T' types of lysimeter were used to measure the concentrations of ammonia N, nitrate N, and total nitrogen (TN) in the leakage of paddy field in rice growth season under different N application levels;The wild-type isoform is composed of four putative domains: a plant-specific organ size regulation (OSR) domain in the N terminus, a transmembrane domain, a tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR/NGFR) family cysteine-rich domain, and a von Willebrand factor type C (VWFC) in the C terminus;Physiological analysis of the OX lines, as well as azygous and wild-type (Wt) controls, was conducted with mature plants after growth under varying nitrate conditions (non-limiting N, limiting N, transfer from non-limiting N to limiting N at panicle emergence) and growth environments (growth chamber vs greenhouse);N is the most important of the mineral nutrients required by plants and its metabolism is tightly coordinated with carbon (C) metabolism in the fundamental processes that permit plant growth;the growth chamber trials) harvest index, N harvest index (spikelet N content/shoot N content) and UtE were generally enhanced in the OX lines relative to their azygous controls;Increased understanding of N regulation may provide important insights for plant growth and improvement of quality of crops and vegetables because N as well as C metabolism are fundamental components of plant life;Rice seedling growth parameters were the greatest in moist irrigation nurseries with inorganic N fertilizer application;By adopting various fertilization measures to maintain proper soil pH and alkali-hydrolyzable N and available P contents, increase soil SO42(-)-S content, and decrease soil Cl(-) content, it could be possible to effectively inhibit the growth of wet weeds and to decrease the total biomass of weeds in double-rice paddy field.;Rubisco contents in each transgenic line declined irrespective of growth stage, and the ratios of Rubisco-N to total N were 66-96% of wild-type levels;A field experiment with different application levels of controlled-release N fertilizer (CRF) was carried out at a rice field in the Nansi lake basin to provide information on the nitrogen uptake rate and use efficiency by rice with CRF application at different growth stages of rice;(4) Nitrogen concentration and accumulation at most growth stages of rice increased with increasing N supply (p < 0.05 or 0.01), but NUEp and NUEg showed the opposite trends;In the growth seasons of winter wheat and oilseed rape under drainage condition and with or without N application, the N2O concentrations at the soil depths 30 cm and 50 cm were significantly higher than those at the soil depths 7 cm and 15 cm; whereas in the early rice growth season under flooding condition and without N application, the N2O concentrations at the soil depth 7 cm and 15 cm were significantly higher than those at the soil depths 30 cm and 50 cm (P < 0.05);The N input from duck sub-system was mainly from the feed N, and the cycling rate of the duck feces N recycled within the system was 2.5% during early rice growth season and 3.5% during late rice growth season;The runoff losses of N and P mainly occurred in crop growth period, and the proportions of N and P losses in the growth period increased with increasing multiple crop index;At the present N input level, there existed soil N deficit during the growth seasons of both early rice and late rice;Applying N fertilizer had significant positive effects on the rice yield, accumulative absorbed N at all growth stages and at each growth stage, and N translocation rate after anthesis (P < 0.01);Comparing with applying N only, balanced fertilization of chemical N, P, and K was more favorable to the accumulation and allocation of C and N in rice plant during its growth period.;Hyacinth mulching increased N concentration and N uptake, decreased NUEp and NUEg at most growth stages of rice.;Many reports have shown that plant growth and yield is superior on mixtures of NO3- and NH4+ compared with provision of either N source alone;This futile cycling carries a high energetic cost (we record a 40% increase in root respiration) that is independent of N metabolism and is accompanied by a decline in growth;We conclude that the growth responses of rice to CO2 enrichment are mainly controlled by leaf area expansion and N allocation into leaf blades at the whole-plant level.;The effects of CO2 enrichment on growth and N allocation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were examined;The effects of growth CO2 levels on the photosynthetic rates; the amounts of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), chlorophyll (Chl), and cytochrome f; sucrose phosphate synthase activity; and total N content were examined in young, fully expanded leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L.);Growth stimulations of non-legumes were reduced at low soil nitrogen, whereas elevated CO2 strongly stimulated the growth of the clover legume both at ample and under low N conditions;A strong immobilization of nitrogen by microorganisms was always followed by a net N mineralization, which was mostly favorable for the growth and development of plant, and improved the use efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer.

AP1	spring growth habit	1	1	12730378	A mutation in the promoter region of AP1 would result in the lack of recognition of the repressor and in a dominant spring growth habit.
TaGA1	development	1	1	12773813	Moreover, both TaGA1 and TaGA2 showed genome-specific expressions in wheat and may participate in the light-regulated growth and development of the seedlings.

N	heterosis	1	1	12812083	The equations of heterosis are [formula: see text] where N is number of genes controlling a trait, a = (Pi - Pj)/2, d is deviation from midparent, while the variance components are all indicated by their names under the respective terms
AR	ash content	1	1	12822955	The AR content of milling fractions closely followed the ash content and could be used as a marker of the presence of bran in flour
SGS1	phenotype	1	1	12856935	The AtRecQsim gene suppressed the MMS hypersensitivity phenotype of the sgs1 cells
